												<h3>BSc in Biology / MSc in Marine Biodiversity</h3>
												<p>Oviedo University (Spain) / Ghent University (Belgium)</p>
											</header>
											<p>My interests in ecology began during my bachelor studies in Biology, where I was actively involved in the ecology department at Oviedo University trying to understand macroalgal diversity and its relationships with the environment and other organisms. Next, I pursued an international Master in Science in Marine Biodiversity and Conservation, where I obtained insights on eukaryotic diversity in today’s oceans and different approaches for its exploration. After gaining this ecological background, I was deeply interested in understanding not only biotic and abiotic relationships, but also exploring how past interactions may have shaped current diversity. Therefore, I carried out a PhD thesis on the molecular evolution and diversity of a widely distributed protist group, the Radiolaria, with Fabrice Not as supervisor at the Biological Station of Roscoff.</p>

												<h3>Molecular diversity and Evolution of Radiolaria</h3>

											<p>During my PhD project I built a reference morpho-molecular framework of Radiolaria, an ubiquitous and abundant planktonic group whose biology is little known. I gained extensive experience on single-cell isolation and characterization of protistan lineages. My PhD began with the characterization of specific orders of Radiolaria, in which I built a taxonomic framework combining morphological synapomorphies and molecular phylogenies to define morpho-molecular clades. Their excellent fossil record allowed me to calibrate a Bayesian molecular clock and to reconstruct their evolutionary history linked to global environmental and geological changes (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S143446101830110X">Sandin <i>et al.</i>, 2019</a>; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1434461021000158">Sandin <i>et al.</i>, 2021</a>). These results were presented in the InterRad congress in Japan, where I was awarded the prize for the best talk for young scientists. The establishment of the reference morpho-molecular framework of Radiolaria allowed me to explore their extant diversity and biogeography in the world oceans by a metabarcoding approach, thanks to global molecular-based datasets such as the Tara oceans or Malaspina expeditions. Altogether, I integrated the most extensive, non-redundant rDNA dataset of Radiolaria to date through a detailed curation of all available molecular barcodes and environmental markers (Sandin <i>et al.</i>, <i>in prep</i>). I have further strengthened a solid expertise on single-cell molecular approaches with the use of novel high-throughput sequencing techniques (such as the MinION sequencing device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies) for the exploration of intragenomic genetic diversity (<a href="https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1462-2920.16081">Sandin <i>et al.</i>, 2022</a>).</p>

												<h3>Eco-evolution of microbial eukaryotes, insights from metabarcoding surveys</h3>
												<p>Evolutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala University (Sweden)</p>
											</header>
											<p>After this wonderful experience I was fascinated by deep and ancient eco-evolutionary processes, and I wanted to challenge the scarce and sporadic fossil record of the early life of eukaryotes. Together with Dr. Fabien Burki developed a postdoctoral project to unveil the evolutionary processes that led eukaryotes to evolve into this incredible diversity that we observe today. In this project, I fit macro-evolutionary models into an ecological perspective to explore the diversification of eukaryotes through geological times at a broad phylogenetic scale. Uniquely, I integrated both long-read and short-read environmental rDNA sequences along with phylogenetically curated reference sequences to access the majority of the known eukaryotic molecular diversity. I then fossil calibrated the eukaryotic tree of life to infer diversification patterns throughout the history of eukaryotes. Here, I am showing that early eukaryotic diversification was initially slow and that biotic interactions established the main groups that we observe today, setting the basis for their later expansion (Sandin <i>et al.</i>, <i>in prep</i>). Through my research, I have acquired extensive knowledge in eukaryotic diversity as well as in large-scale phylogenetic analysis, leading to the publication of a review on the state of the art of microbial eukaryotes (protists) diversity (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221010563">Burki, Sandin and Jamy, 2021</a>).</p>

												<h3>The hidden majority: high-resolution imaging and genomics of the most ecologically important microbial eukaryotes in the ocean</h3>

											</header>
											<p>In my next postdoctoral project, I will merge efforts with Daniel Richter and Ramon Massana to explore the vast undescribed diversity of microbial eukaryotes that we only know from their short environmental DNA sequences. I will unveil the morphology and genomes of uncharted protist to study their role in the macro-evolution of eukaryotes. This project will attempt to reconstruct an unbiased evolutionary history of eukaryotes.</p>
